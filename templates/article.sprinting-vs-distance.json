Different runners have varying preferences for how much cushioning they prefer, and Feetures offers all levels, from extra light cushioning to max cushioning. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Compression is a key element of the best running socks for long distances. The compression elements in quality long-distance running socks help improve circulation, allowing blood to flow more freely to the heart and oxygen to the lungs and muscles. Compression socks can help long-distance runners breathe and run more efficiently. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best long-distance running socks feature breathable, moisture-wicking materials that keep feet cool and dry.
