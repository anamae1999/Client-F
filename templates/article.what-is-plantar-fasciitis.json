Therefore, understanding <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what causes plantar fasciitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is essential. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the tightrope of the plantar fascia becomes inflamed, the connective muscle, known as the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB), tends to overcompensate—often resulting in additional pain or possible tears. Many things can cause your plantar fascia to become inflamed, including age, certain types of exercises, foot mechanics, obesity, and occupations that require you to stand for long hours daily. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few other myths about <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what causes plantar fasciitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the truth about the condition.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Plantar Fasciitis is Caused by Flat Feet<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Truth: <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5449819\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 25%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the population has flat feet. However, this is not a cause of plantar fasciitis. Having flat feet may increase your risk of developing plantar fasciitis, but it’s not the underlying reason. Improper arch support, working a job that requires you to be on your feet, overexercising, and even changes in your diet can all contribute to the development of plantar fasciitis, whether you have flat feet or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Plantar Fasciitis is Caused by Heel Spurs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Truth:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While many people with plantar fasciitis do have heel spurs, they’re not <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what causes plantar fasciitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In fact, these are actually two very different conditions with distinctly different treatments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A heel spur is a bony outgrowth under the surface of the heel bone. In most cases, heel spurs don’t cause any pain or have adverse effects on a person’s quality of life. The plantar fascia is a deep connective tissue that spans from the bottom of the heel bone, which is another reason for this misconception. Even though heel spurs and plantar fasciitis occur in the same general area, there is no direct link between the presence of the two.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Plantar Fasciitis is Permanent<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Truth:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Even though the road to recovery from plantar fasciitis can seem long, slow, and maybe even never-ending, it’s not a permanent condition. Like most medical conditions, there’s no one-cure-fits-all <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plantar fasciitis treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but a variety of options to manage the pain and expedite recovery. If you believe you have plantar fasciitis, your doctor should thoroughly assess your condition and construct a tailored management and recovery plan to get you back on your feet.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Fixing Plantar Fasciitis Requires Big Surgery<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Truth: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantar fasciitis doesn’t always require surgery, and in most cases, it’s completely unnecessary. People can often receive <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">plantar fasciitis treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that requires less invasive, more conservative methods. A doctor can assess your condition and suggest the best treatment plan that helps relieve the pain and ultimately heals the injury. If surgery is required, it luckily no longer requires a large incision. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/plantar-fasciitis-surgery\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantar fasciitis surgery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is much less invasive now, only requiring two keyhole-size incisions, minimizing scarring and allowing for a quicker recovery.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Minimalist Style Running Will Prevent, or Cure, Plantar Fasciitis<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Truth:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When minimalist – or barefoot – running was a trend, there were claims that it was a cure for plantar fasciitis. The theory was that minimalist running would strengthen the intrinsic muscles of the feet. However, this claim is purely a myth. There is no scientific evidence that supports this. In fact, no specific running style has been proven to prevent or cure plantar fasciitis.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Myth: Only Athletes Get Plantar Fasciitis<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><b>Truth:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Plantar fasciitis affects many facets of the population, and athletic stress isn’t the only cause. Many people who aren’t athletes can be affected by plantar fasciitis. Poor foot mechanics, improper footwear, overuse, obesity, and poor environmental conditions can all be contributing factors causing plantar fasciitis, regardless of whether or not you’re an athlete.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantar Fasciitis Treatment<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Options to Relieve Pain<\/span>\n<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few ways to train and strengthen the flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) to avoid trouble with plantar fasciitis and tips to relieve pain.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Stretch<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You’ve heard it before, but every stretch from your core to the tips of your toes is key. Stretch your toes by standing and pushing them up against a wall with heels flat (and wiggling). Hold for anywhere between 10 and 30 seconds.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Golf or Tennis Ball Massage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While watching your favorite season of Yellowstone, you can “roll out” your plantar fasciitis injury. Imagine your foot as your hand and the ball as a game of Centipede. Apologies to anyone under the age of 35 reading this.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Foam Rolling<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foam rolling is not just for the IT band anymore. Everything is connected, and tightness in the hips, shoulders, arms, and legs can invite plantar fasciitis to the party.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Decrease Mileage and Intensity &amp; Change Surfaces<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantar fasciitis can be brought on by a sudden increase in mileage, increased intensity, or a switch of terrain (from flat to hills) during workouts. Not surprisingly, the best way to undo the damage underfoot is to roll back mileage, take the intensity down a notch, or run on soft, even surfaces. The old doctor joke punchline, “Don’t go like that,” applies to plantar fasciitis sufferers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Adjust Your Stride<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Runners should also pay attention to how they strike. Heel striking and a shortened stride length are recommended while the plantar fascia is getting healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Wear <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plantar Fasciitis Socks<\/span>\n<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Socks for plantar fasciitis<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> help reduce pain and inflammation and enhance recovery by applying support along key pressure points on the ankle, arch, and heel.
